# EGO DIGITAL BANK

EGO digital bank is a fictional digital banking service (ego meanimg money in my language) that i personally thought of for the sake of practic and the improvement of my frontend skills. i am open to crititizms and advice on how i could improve the look and code of this website.

I will try my best to constantly format the code and make it less beginner like as my skills improve.
I would appreciate it if the concepts are not copied

# The project was created with the desktop size of 1440px or greater and mobile phone size of 425px(large phones) in mind but can still adapt to smaller phone sizes a little.

# This is the deploy link: https://egodigitalbank.netlify.app/

So far people have made great comments about it like:

1. I think its great. Did you base it off Ego the living planet ? -- Sir Darlignton.
2. I think its nice -- Purity.
3. Wow -- Sir Mela.
4. Forget that i don't want to talk about it but it actually looks very nice. you are actually doing well. -- Oscar

The same group of people gave constructive crititizms like:

4. There could have been more to the graphics. it should have been more classy -- Purity.
5. Work on the texts. Some are too small some not well aligned -- Sir Darlignton.
6. Why did you choose the dark background ? , why not go for a catchy background...a more appealing background -- Sir Mela
7. It still kinda looks like a ponzi scheme website instead of a bank -- Oscar & Emmanuel

My thoughts: i think its very nice , considering the fact that this is the first time i have made something like this but trying not to be blinded by my love for my project i have listened to what my friends have said and i have concluded that the design is too simple for a bank.
